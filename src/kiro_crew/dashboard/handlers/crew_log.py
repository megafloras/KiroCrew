"""Read routes and the push frame for a session's CREW LOG.

Two reads and one push, which is the split RFC section 5 asks for: the backend
folds and cuts pages, the frontend renders and pages and never folds (NFR-2).

- ``GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log?from=&to=`` -- the entries in a seq range,
  with every ``ref`` on the page resolved (FR-4).
- ``GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log/projection/{name}`` -- one fold's value and
  the ``seq`` it was folded through (FR-5).
- a ``session_projection`` frame per projection whose value moves, pushed when a
  session's crew log grows.

Both routes are gated on the DASHBOARD OWNER, and that is this layer answering a
question the storage layer declines to: ``resolve`` makes no authorization claim
because it has no caller identity to derive one from, and says the first caller
with a permission model owns it. These routes are that caller. A crew log holds
the session's message BODIES, redacted but whole, so the audience is the one
person the conversation belongs to -- which is also why the push goes to owner
sockets rather than every authorized one, an app token among them. The gate is
``require_owner_dashboard_request`` inside each handler; the module also stands
behind ``guard_owner_surface_routes``, which refuses a private member's scoped
caller, so a route added here later is refused rather than open by omission.

The page read and the fold read differ in one deliberate way. A FOLD passes its
vocabulary to ``iter_from``, so an entry from a newer writer stops it instead of
skewing a total nobody can see is wrong. A PAGE passes none: it renders history
for a person, where an unfamiliar line is a missing detail rather than a
corrupted answer, and refusing the whole page for one line would hide the
history in front of it. That is the posture ``ledger-core`` states for ``page``
and ``resolve``, applied to a range read.
The storage package is imported LAZILY here, on the first call that needs it,
never at module import. The crew log is an optional subsystem behind
``KIROCREW_SESSION_LEDGER``, this module is reachable from the dashboard's boot
path, and a gateway launched with the flag unset must not pay to load a store it
will not read -- the same split the emitter keeps, and one a test pins from a
clean interpreter.
