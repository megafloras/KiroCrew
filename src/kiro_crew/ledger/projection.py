"""Folds over ONE session's crew log -- the session side panel's five views.

A projection folds one crew log and carries that log's ``seq`` as its version
(RFC FR-5), so a reader that holds a projection at seq N and reads the entries
after N reaches the same value a reader folding the whole file from scratch
does. That equality is the module's contract and the property its tests pin.

The INCREMENTAL form is the primitive here and the whole-file form wraps it. A
fold is three pure pieces -- a starting state, one step per entry, and a render
-- and :func:`fold` is those pieces run over every entry. A separate batch
implementation would be a second codepath that can disagree with the resumed
one about the same bytes, and nothing in the file would say which is right.

State is JSON-serializable and is the CHECKPOINT: a caller may store it, hand it
back later with the seq it was taken at, and continue. It is deliberately not
the rendered value. A fold keeps bookkeeping a reader has no use for (the open
tool calls it is matching by ``call_id``, the attempt an open turn is on), and
:func:`Checkpoint.state` holding exactly what the fold needs to continue is what
lets the render stay the surface the dashboard reads.

Absent is never read as zero. ``turn/completed`` carries ``credits`` and
``tokens`` only on a provider-reported close, so a synthesized closer omits them
-- and a total that counted those turns as costing nothing would state a
measurement nobody made. Each total therefore rides beside the count of turns
that contributed to it, and a caller comparing the two learns what the total
covers.

Nothing here synthesizes history. An interrupted turn and an unmatched tool call
are reported as OPEN, never closed with an invented outcome: closing them is the
store's ``repair=True``, which appends real deterministic closers under write
ownership, and a reader inventing the same fact in memory would make two readers
of one file disagree.

This module reads its own unit's file and nothing else (FR-4: no fold reads more
than its own ledger). Resolving a ``ref`` is the PAGE path's work, in the routes
that serve a person a citation to follow.
